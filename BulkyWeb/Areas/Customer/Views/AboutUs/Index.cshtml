                    Hey! I’m <strong>Kajol Agrawal</strong>, the founder of KurlStop. I grew up with curly hair, and all my life was told they weren’t ‘right’. I had no idea how to care for them, from keratin, smoothening, to blow-dries for parties, I damaged my hair to an extent where all I could do was look for solutions to heal them.
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark">
                    That's when I made FMC, we’re clean, easy to use, and here to help you embrace your natural texture! Wavy, Curly, or Kinky, we have the product for you. Not only do we give you products worth investing in, but a community full of curly heads to talk with, meet, and share your life-long journey with :) We love your curls, and so should you! I’ve been there, but trust us when we tell you there’s an easier way. Never let another aunty tell you to get rid of the ‘frizz’.
